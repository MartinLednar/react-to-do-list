# About project
This is simple To-do list app made with CRA. I built this application to test and prove my understanding of React and Firebase basics while taking [Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course.
